          With over 1.5 years of hands-on experience in Video Editing, and Graphic Design, I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with some amazing brands and clients across diverse industries.

          Here’s a glimpse of the brands and clients I’ve worked with:

              E-Commerce Brands: Designed A websites  logo and landing pages for retail businesses, improving conversion rates and enhancing user experiences.
           Tech Innovators: Created sleek.<br />
         Content Creators & Influencers: Delivered engaging video edits, promotional graphics, and social media content that helped boost visibility and engagement.
        Small Businesses: Provided customized design solutions (logos, business cards, brochures) to help local businesses stand out in their market.  <br />
         Through every project, I've gained valuable insights into various industries, and my mission remains the same: to help each client tell their unique story through design and content that resonates with their target audience.
